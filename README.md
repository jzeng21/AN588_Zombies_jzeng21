This homework was fun but definitely time-consumingâ€”I had to look up several resources to guide me through the process.

One thing I really enjoyed was writing a for loop inside a function. It made the logic behind bootstrapping more intuitive and the coding process genuinely enjoyable.

Like many others, I initially forgot to include the bootstrap component and had to go back to add it in, but it helped reinforce the concept.

Overall, I thought this was a great assignment. I learned a lot and enjoyed both the coding and the problem-solving involved.
